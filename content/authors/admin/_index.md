      Thesis Title: ‚ÄúSign language translation to text using image processing‚Äù 

      It is imperative that technology advances to support individuals facing communication challenges. For those who are unable to speak, this barrier should not impede their progress. To address this, I have developed a program designed to facilitate effortless communication or interviews for such individuals. This project employs image processing techniques combined with deep learning algorithms to translate sign language gestures into text, achieving a commendable accuracy of 90 percent.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
